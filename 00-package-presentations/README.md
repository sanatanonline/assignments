Package Presentations
=====================

*R* by itself is a fairly modest piece of software. Like other languages, it supports a fairly limited syntax with a somewhat narrow and focused functionality. As with any successful open source language, R owes it success to a community which extends of the language by contributing extensions to the base language. These packages are available on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org). To become an effective data scientist, it is essential to learn the functionality of dozens of these packages. We will learn these by teaching each other.

# Package Presentations

*R* by itself is a fairly modest piece of software. Like other languages, it 
supports a fairly limited syntax with a somewhat narrow and focused 
functionality. As with any successful open source language, R owes it success to a 
community which extends of the language by contributing extensions to the base
language. These packages are available on 
[The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org). To 
become an effective data scientist, it is essential to learn the functionality 
of dozens of these packages. We will learn these by teaching each other.


## Assignment

Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation on an assigned packages.  

Your presentation should:

 * Explain/Demonstrate the use(s) of the package;  
   * Identify useful 
   * Identify resources for becoming proficient for using the package
 * Indentify packages that provide complementary or similar functions
 * Provide your evaluation/opinon of the package.
 

We will have four presentation per week.

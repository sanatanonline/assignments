 - You should always be direct as this is considerate of people's time. This 
   means you should
   - Lead with the project/busines goal.
   - Be concise.
   - Omit boilerplate
 
 - Remener your audience. 
   - Audience is a non-technical one, descriptions of hardware, software, modeling
     techinique, code management are not necessary for this document.
   
 - You need define success criteria and how it will be quantified and measured 
   - for the project, this can be "swaggy", but you need to have something. The
     reason for this is it makes the business partners thing about the problem 
     in a way that they may not have previously.
   - And for the model. You should try and connect the two.
   
 - You should have a very clear idea of how the effort will be consumed and used.
 
 - It is okay (in practice) to have placeholders to have things TBD as things
   are often negotiated with other parts of the organization.
   
 - Success criteria are:
   - quantitative
   - measurable 
   Remember **SMART** 
   
 - Please put your homework in the correct assignment folder
 
 - Risks should assume the model is correct. What are the things that can 
   derail the projects success.
  
  - You need to clearly specify how your model(s) will be evaluated
